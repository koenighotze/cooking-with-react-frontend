      title: 'Mushroom Aguachile',
      description:
        'Aguachile is traditionally made with shrimp, but since 2023 is going to be all about mushrooms, we decided to try it out. King oyster mushrooms have a meaty texture and pair well with the herby, citrusy marinade.',
      instructions:
        '1. Make the aguachile: On a mandoline, thinly slice the mushroom stems crosswise into rounds (reserve the mushroom caps for another use). Transfer to a bowl or deep container. Thinly slice the red onion on the mandoline and add to the bowl with the mushrooms.\n' +
        '2. In a blender, combine the cilantro, cucumber, serrano, jalapeño, garlic, lime juice, vinegar, and salt and blend on high speed until smooth, about 30 seconds.\n' +
        '3. Pour the marinade over the mushrooms and onion and stir to coat completely. Let sit for 5–10 minutes.\n' +
        '4. While the mushrooms are marinating, prepare the garnishes: using a mandoline, thinly slice the cucumber into rounds. Thinly slice the red onion.\n' +
        '5. To serve, arrange the sliced cucumber on a serving plate. Spoon the marinated mushrooms and onion on top, along with some of the marinade. Garnish with the thinly sliced red onion, cilantro, and black pepper. Serve immediately.\n' +
        '6. Enjoy!',
